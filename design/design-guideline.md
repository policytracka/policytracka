# Design Guideline for PolicyTracka : Clean and Colorful Design with Dark Blue, Orange, Yellow, Teal, and Aqua

## Introduction
This design guideline aims to create a clean and colorful design that primarily uses dark blue, orange, yellow, teal, and aqua as its color palette. These colors can be used in various ways to create a visually appealing design while maintaining a clean and organized look.

## Layout
The layout should be simple and easy to navigate. Use dark blue as the primary background color to create a clean and professional feel. Use white for the majority of text content, with the exception of headlines or other elements that need to stand out.

## Color Palette
The color palette consists of dark blue, orange, yellow, teal, and aqua. Use these colors to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. Dark blue can be used for the background, while orange, yellow, teal, and aqua can be used for accents such as buttons, icons, or other interactive elements.

## Typography
Use a clean and easy-to-read font for body text, such as Arial or Open Sans. For headlines or other important text, use a bold font to make it stand out. Consider using orange, yellow, teal, or aqua for headline text to add a pop of color.

## Images
Use high-quality images that fit with the color palette and theme of the design. If the images have different colors, consider using a filter or adjustment layer to match them with the dark blue, orange, yellow, teal, and aqua color scheme.

## Whitespace
Whitespace is an important aspect of a clean design. Use ample whitespace to create a sense of spaciousness and organization. This can also help highlight important elements on the page.

## Consistency
Consistency is key in creating a cohesive design. Use the same colors, fonts, and style throughout the design. This will create a sense of unity and help guide the user through the design.
