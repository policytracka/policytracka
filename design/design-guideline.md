# Design Guideline for PolicyTracka : Clean and Colorful with White, Orange, and Yellow

## Introduction:
This design guideline aims to create a clean and colorful design that primarily uses white, orange, and yellow as its color palette. These colors can be used in various ways to create a visually appealing design while maintaining a clean and organized look.

## Layout:
The layout should be simple and easy to navigate. Use white as the primary background color to create a clean and spacious feel. White can also be used for the majority of text content, with the exception of headlines or other elements that need to stand out.

## Color Palette:
The color palette consists of white, orange, and yellow. Use these colors to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. Orange and yellow can be used for accents, such as buttons, icons, or other interactive elements.

## Typography:
Use a clean and easy-to-read font for body text, such as Arial or Open Sans. For headlines or other important text, use a bold font to make it stand out. Consider using orange or yellow for headline text to add a pop of color.

## Images:
Use high-quality images that fit with the color palette and theme of the design. If the images have different colors, consider using a filter or adjustment layer to match them with the white, orange, and yellow color scheme.

## Whitespace:
Whitespace is an important aspect of a clean design. Use ample whitespace to create a sense of spaciousness and organization. This can also help highlight important elements on the page.

## Consistency:
Consistency is key in creating a cohesive design. Use the same colors, fonts, and style throughout the design. This will create a sense of unity and help guide the user through the design.
